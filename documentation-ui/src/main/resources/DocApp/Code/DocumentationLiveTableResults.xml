## Exclude the DocApp Code and Data spaces so that entries from there are not listed in LiveDatas.
#set ($extra = 'AND doc.space &lt;&gt; :docapp_code_space AND doc.space &lt;&gt; :docapp_data_space')
#set ($params = {'docapp_code_space' : 'DocApp.Code', 'docapp_data_space' : 'DocApp.Data'})
## Also exclude the current page, if asked.
#if ("$!request.current" != '')
  #set ($extra = "$extra AND doc.fullName &lt;&gt; :docapp_currentdoc")
  #set ($discard = $params.put('docapp_currentdoc', "$!request.current"))
#end
## Use filterLocation since addLivetableLocationFilter is buggy when called several times (it'll add the
## same HQL binding name every time it's called! See https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-17463).
## Also note that we don't call addLocationFilter since we use a Map for $params.
#filterLocation($extra, $params, $!request.location, 'locationFilterValue1')
#gridresultwithfilter("$!request.classname" $request.collist.split(',') '' "${extra}" $params)
